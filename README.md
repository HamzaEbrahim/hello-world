First repository, part of the GitHub intro tutorial. 

Hello!

My name is Hamza but you should already know that if you're reading this. I'm trying to learn and become better at Data Science. I am familiarising myself with the tools you should know if you want to be a Data Scientist, which is why I am here on GitHub.

I have a little bit of programming experiencing. I studied Computer Science for about 18 months at University so I know Python and a little bit of Java. While my Data Science and programming knowledge is still relatively rudimentary, I am going to try document my journey learning everything I need to know and store it here on GitHub.

Here's hoping the road ahead is not too arduous!
